//1. O(1)

//2. O(n)

//2. Even or odd

//Answer O(1) no matter how big the number it will always go throught the same small process

//3. Are you here?

//Answer O(n^2) because it's two loops. So it will be to the second power.

//4. Doubler

//ANSWER: O(n) It has to iterate through every number so it's linear.

//5. Naive search

//ANSWER: O(n) it is O(n) because it goes through each item in the array but it could be a lot faster than just O(n) because it doesn't have to iterate through every number since it stops when it finds the right index.

//6. Creating pairs

//ANSWER: O(n^2) because it's two loops and ones nested

//7. Compute the sequence

//ANSWER O(n) because it's going through all the numbers in a linear fashon with the loop and does simple computing in between

//8. An efficient search

//ANSWER O(log n) its O(logn) because it cuts the problem in half each time making it faster than linear.

//9. Random element

//ANSWER O(1) the same process is run no matter how long the array.

//10. What Am I?

//ANSWER: O(1) it's the same run time no matter what because it doesn't loop or have an array input

//11. Tower of Hanoi

//ANSWER: O(2^n)

//because it's a lenthy process that increases in data load as it continues
